Given two strings A and B of lowercase letters, return true if you can swap two
letters in A so the result is equal to B, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that
i != j and swapping the characters at A[i] and A[j]. For example, swapping at
indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

Does npt work for 
A = "aa"
B = "aa" i.e. words with same indices
